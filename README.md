RULES OF THE GAME:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- PERSONAL RULE ADDED: REBUTTLE ROUND
  - When Player 1 wins it's technically unfair because they received 1 more turn than Player 2
  - Because of this, when Player 1 wins Player 2 gets 1 turn to reach the goal score (100), too
  - If Player 2 hits the goal score it is increase by 25 and both players keep playing

PERSONAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Various UI changes for my perferred tastes
- Additional refractoring
- Additional rules regarding Player 2 Rebuttle
